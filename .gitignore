# Dataset (Keep archive distinct if needed, but usually we don't commit large CSVs)
# Assuming user might want to keep data/archive in the repo if it's small, 
# but the user said "games_details.csv" is 93MB. It's better to ignore it or track it with LFS.
# For this request, I will adhere to "non-essential files aren't committed".
